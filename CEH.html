    const cehData = [
      { question: "What is the primary purpose of footprinting in ethical hacking?", answer: "To gather information about a target system or organization before launching an attack." },
      { question: "Which port does HTTPS typically use?", answer: "Port 443 is used for secure HTTP traffic using SSL/TLS." },
      { question: "What is a common tool used for network scanning?", answer: "Nmap is widely used for discovering hosts and services on a network." },
      { question: "What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?", answer: "Symmetric uses one key for encryption/decryption; asymmetric uses a public/private key pair." },
      { question: "Which layer of the OSI model does a packet filter firewall operate on?", answer: "Packet filtering firewalls operate primarily at the Network layer (Layer 3)." },
      { question: "What is the purpose of a honeypot?", answer: "To attract and deceive attackers, while monitoring their activities in a controlled environment." },
      { question: "What is SQL injection?", answer: "An attack method that allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL code on a database by manipulating input fields." },
      { question: "Which protocol is used for secure email communication?", answer: "SMTPS (Secure SMTP) is used for encrypted email communication." },
      { question: "What is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack?", answer: "An attack where the attacker intercepts and potentially alters communication between two parties." },
      { question: "What is a common tool for password cracking?", answer: "John the Ripper is a popular password cracking tool used by ethical hackers." },
      { question: "What is a buffer overflow?", answer: "An error where a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, leading to potential vulnerabilities." },
      { question: "What is the purpose of a firewall?", answer: "A firewall is designed to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules." },
      { question: "Which port is used for FTP?", answer: "FTP uses port 21 for control and port 20 for data transfer." },
      { question: "What does the acronym VPN stand for?", answer: "VPN stands for Virtual Private Network, used to create a secure, encrypted connection over the internet." },
      { question: "What is the difference between a virus and a worm?", answer: "A virus requires a host to spread, while a worm can spread autonomously across networks." },
      { question: "What is reconnaissance in ethical hacking?", answer: "Reconnaissance is the initial phase of gathering information about a target system or network." },
      { question: "What does SSL stand for?", answer: "SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer, a protocol for establishing secure connections over a network." },
      { question: "What is a Trojan horse?", answer: "A Trojan horse is a malicious program that disguises itself as a legitimate file or software." },
      { question: "What is social engineering?", answer: "Social engineering is the manipulation of people into divulging confidential information for malicious purposes." },
      { question: "What is the purpose of encryption?", answer: "Encryption is used to convert data into a secure format to prevent unauthorized access." },
      { question: "What is a vulnerability scanner?", answer: "A vulnerability scanner is a tool used to identify potential security weaknesses in a system or network." },
      { question: "What is a DDoS attack?", answer: "A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack attempts to overload a system or network with traffic to make it unavailable." },
      { question: "What is the purpose of penetration testing?", answer: "Penetration testing involves simulating an attack on a system to identify and fix vulnerabilities." },
      { question: "What is the OSI model?", answer: "The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in seven layers." },
      { question: "What is phishing?", answer: "Phishing is a technique used to deceive users into revealing personal information by pretending to be a trusted entity." },
      { question: "What is a brute-force attack?", answer: "A brute-force attack involves trying every possible combination to crack a password or encryption." },
      { question: "What is an IDS?", answer: "An IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is a tool used to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity." },
      { question: "What is a botnet?", answer: "A botnet is a network of infected computers used for malicious purposes, often for DDoS attacks." },
      { question: "What is data exfiltration?", answer: "Data exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of data from a system to an external location." },
      { question: "What is two-factor authentication?", answer: "Two-factor authentication requires two forms of identification before granting access, enhancing security." },
      { question: "What is a zero-day vulnerability?", answer: "A zero-day vulnerability is a flaw in software that is unknown to the vendor and has no available patch." },
      { question: "What is port scanning?", answer: "Port scanning is the process of identifying open ports and services on a system to assess vulnerabilities." },
      { question: "What is the difference between a black hat hacker and a white hat hacker?", answer: "Black hat hackers engage in illegal activities, while white hat hackers work to improve security by identifying vulnerabilities." },
      { question: "What is the goal of ethical hacking?", answer: "The goal is to identify and fix security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious attackers." }
